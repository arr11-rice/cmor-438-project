# Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

## a. A brief description of the algorithms implemented.

This repository implements four unsupervised learning algorithms from scratch:

- **K-Means Clustering**: Partitions data into k clusters based on feature similarity.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: A dimensionality reduction technique that, given a number of desired dimensions, finds the dimensions of most variability (principle components) for the data and maps the data there, to reduce dimensions while limitin loss of information as much as possible.
- **DBSCAN** (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): Identifies clusters without needing a set number of clusters to make using the distance between points and their classification, including core, edge, and noise, or outlier, points (which it leaves out of clusters).
- **Image Compression** with the **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Uses matrix factorization to reduce image data size while preserving essential structure.

## b. A summary of the datasets used for each algorithm.

- **K-Means Clustering**: A dataset of popular spotify songs, I restricted it to the top 40 most popular for the implementation, which formed K clusters based on each song's danceability, key, and energy.
- **PCA**: A high-dimensitionality dataset containing gene expression levels across different types of leukemiaâ€”64 samples, 22,284 genes, and labels for 5 types of leukemia. 
- **DBSCAN**: A dataset of bird physical measurements (10 total measurements, length and diameter of five differnt bones). 
- **Image Compression** with **SVD**: 


## c. Instructions for reproducing your results

To run any algorithm in the Unsupervised Learning folder, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone my repository from the following link: https://github.com/arr11-rice/cmor-438-project

### 2. Navigate to this folder
```bash
cd cmor-438-project/2. Unsupervised Learning/
```
OR:
You may have to try,
```bash
cd cmor-438-project/   
cd "2. Unsupervised Learning"
```
### 3. Navigate further to the desired subfolder
For example,
```bash
cd "1. K-Means Clustering"
```
### 3. Install Dependencies: 

Install the needed Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Finally, run the notebook
For example, 
```bash
jupyter notebook KMC.ipynb
```
Simply run the cells in order from top to bottom.
